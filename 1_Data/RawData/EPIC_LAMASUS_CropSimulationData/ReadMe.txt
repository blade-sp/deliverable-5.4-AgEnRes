Land
----------------------
CRP: arable land

Variables
----------------------
YLD: yield at common moisture (t/ha)
FTN: nitrogen application rates (kgN/ha)

Intensity scenario
----------------------
M1.rf: very-low intensity, rainfed
M2.rf: low intensity, rainfed
M3.rf: medium intensity, rainfed
M4.rf: high intensity, rainfed
M5.rf: very-high intensity, rainhfed
M5.ir: very-high intensity, irrigated

Note:
These intensity scenario simulations were used to calculate the yield response surfaces in LAMASUS. Please note that the N fertilization gradient (FTN) driving the yield responses varies across scenarios and differs between countries.
Crop yield (YLD) represents a long-term mean calculated for the reference period 2001-2020.
