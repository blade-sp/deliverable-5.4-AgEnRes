  - `FertilizerPrices.csv`            Historical fertilizer price data.
  - `WheatPrices.csv`                 Historical wheat price data.
   
- **2_Scripts/**                  
  - `MainScript.R`                    The core analytical script.
  
- **3_Outputs/**                      Generated outputs from the scripts.

## Prerequisities
