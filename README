# Behavioral Input Price Risk Management

This repository contains the data and R code for the research on "Behavioral Input Price Risk Management". The analysis focuses on the nitrogen-yield relationship, price dynamics between wheat and fertilizer (CAN), and contract payoff simulations.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **1_Data/** 
  - `RawData/`: Includes raw outputs from the EPIC crop simulation model and PPI data.
  - `FertilizerPrices.csv`: Historical fertilizer price data.
  - `WheatPrices.csv`: Historical wheat price data.
  - `Adjusted_Prices.csv`: Prices adjusted for inflation/PPI.
  
- **2_Scripts/** 
  - `MainScript.R`: The core analytical script.
  - `CropSimulation_Cleaning.R`: Cleans and prepares the EPIC crop simulation data.
  - `PriceData_Cleaning.R`: Cleans and prepares the market price data.
  
- **3_Outputs/**: Generated outputs from the scripts.

## Prerequisities

To run the code, you will need **R** installed along with the following packages:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "quantreg",
  "readxl",
  "modelsummary",
  "robustbase",
  "tidyverse",
  "vars",
  "tseries",
  "patchwork",
  "urca",
  "moments",
  "RColorBrewer"
))
```

## Usage

1.  **(Optional) Data Preparation**: The data in `1_Data/` should be ready for analysis. If you need to regenerate the cleaned datasets from raw sources, run:
    - `2_Scripts/CropSimulation_Cleaning.R`
    - `2_Scripts/PriceData_Cleaning.R`

2.  **Main Analysis**: Run `2_Scripts/MainScript.R` to reproduce the main results.
